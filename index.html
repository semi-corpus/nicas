						<p align="center" style="font-size : 21px" > This is our first project from Dawan formation about GIT </P>
						<p align="center"> GIT is a program about creating various version for the same work project; 
						it help to save the states of a project at different moments of his creation 
						keeping is hole story archived. Making accessible every state of the project at any moment to everyone.	
						</P>
						<p align="center"> GIT is based on distributed architecture, 
						that make every workgroup working independent in local with a centralized hub 
						generally a git-hub platform project. Every dev working on the project can gather information
						about the project with ease thanks to commit comment and tag about all steps maked by other dev.
						After the end step of the project you still can access older version and new version without loosing the sight of the actual project. 
						To finalized we can say that git is great working group that make proffetional or personal projects safe of deletion and easy to follow
						during their creation/evolution.
